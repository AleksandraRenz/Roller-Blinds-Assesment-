ACTIVITY: 
A local roller blinds business has asked you to write a small script which will allow customers to visit their website and gain a quotation for the the cost of blinds and installation. 
 
You must create and document a starter version of this script which will:- 
a)	Prompt the customer for the number of windows to be fitted with blinds.  
b)	For each window your script should then:- 
    i) Prompt for the height of the window (in metres) 
    ii) Prompt for the width of the window (in metres) 
    iii) Calculate the area of that window 
    iv) Calculate the cost of the blind for that window … 
    ▪	less than 1 square metre = £35 
    ▪	at least 1 square metre but less than 2 square metres = £45
    ▪ 	2 square metres or more = £55 
    iv)	Show the user the cost of the blind for that window 
    v)	Add the cost of that blind to the total cost 
c)	After all the windows have been input your script should then display the total cost of the blinds 
d)	Ask the customer to choose if installation is required. The user should answer Y or N. If the answer is Y then add £10 per blind to the total bill 
e)	Ask whether the customer is liable to pay VAT. The user should answer Y or N. If the answer is Y then add VAT at 20% to the total bill  
f)	Show the total cost of blinds for all the windows
